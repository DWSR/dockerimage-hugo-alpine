= Alpine-Based Hugo Docker Image

== Description

This is a Docker image containing link:https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo[hugo]. It is intended to be
used to as part of the development cycle of a Hugo-powered static site. It is *not* intended to be
used in any production-like setups.

Hugo expects the site to be located in the `WORKDIR`, which is `/hugo-site` by default. If you are
basing your own image from this one, you can either override this or copy your site contents there.

== Examples

=== Serve Site Locally

This will run Hugo in its `serve` mode, which will build and rebuild the contents of the site as it
is changed. To access the local site, point your browser at `http://localhost:1313`.

[source, sh]
----
docker run -p 1313:1313 -v "$(pwd):/hugo-site" --rm hugo-alpine
----

=== Build Site

This will build the site and place it in the `public/` folder.

[source, sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd):/hugo-site" --rm hugo-alpine hugo
----
